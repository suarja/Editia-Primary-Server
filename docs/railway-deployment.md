# Railway Deployment Guide with FFmpeg

This guide explains how to deploy the video analysis service to Railway with FFmpeg support.

## üöÇ Railway + FFmpeg Setup

Based on [Railway FFmpeg Forum Discussion](https://railway.app/help/fix-ffmpeg-issues), we use system FFmpeg instead of npm packages.

### 1. Configuration Files

**Create `nixpacks.toml` in project root:**

```toml
# Railway deployment configuration with FFmpeg support
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ['ffmpeg', 'nodejs_18', 'npm']

[phases.build]
cmds = [
    'npm ci',
    'npm run build'
]

[start]
cmd = 'npm start'

[env]
NODE_ENV = 'production'
RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT = 'production'
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Set these in Railway dashboard:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=production
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
```

### 3. Code Adaptations

Our service automatically detects Railway environment and uses system FFmpeg:

```typescript
// Automatic environment detection
const isRailway = process.env.RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT === "production";

// FFmpeg path detection
if (isRailway || process.platform === "linux") {
  // Use system FFmpeg installed via nixpacks
  const ffmpegPath = execSync("which ffmpeg", { encoding: "utf8" }).trim();
} else {
  // Local development fallback
  // Try system first, then npm package
}
```

## üîß Troubleshooting Railway FFmpeg

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### 1. FFmpeg Not Found

**Problem:** `FFmpeg not found` error in Railway logs

**Solution:**

- Ensure `nixpacks.toml` includes `ffmpeg` in nixPkgs
- Redeploy after adding configuration
- Check logs for FFmpeg path detection

#### 2. Fast Completion (No Processing)

**Problem:** FFmpeg completes instantly (like 10-100ms) but no output file

**Symptoms from Railway Forum:**

- Exit code: null
- No stderr output
- No output file created

**Solution:**

- Use system FFmpeg via nixpkgs (not npm packages)
- Use `which ffmpeg` to get correct path
- Ensure proper spawn arguments

#### 3. Storage Volume Issues

**Problem:** Files not being written to temp directory

**Solution:**

- Use `/tmp` directory (Railway provides ephemeral storage)
- Ensure directory exists before writing
- Clean up temp files after processing

#### 4. Container Permissions

**Problem:** Permission denied errors

**Solution:**

- Use Railway's default `/tmp` directory
- Don't mount custom storage volumes for temp files
- Ensure proper file permissions

### Environment Differences

| Environment       | FFmpeg Source   | Path Detection | Temp Directory |
| ----------------- | --------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| **Railway**       | nixpkgs         | `which ffmpeg` | `/tmp`         |
| **Local Mac**     | System/Homebrew | `which ffmpeg` | `./temp`       |
| **Local Linux**   | System/apt      | `which ffmpeg` | `./temp`       |
| **Local Windows** | npm package     | import path    | `./temp`       |

## üìä Deployment Process

### 1. Railway Project Setup

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and create project
railway login
railway init
```

### 2. Deploy to Railway

```bash
# Deploy current branch
railway up

# Or connect GitHub repository
# Set up GitHub integration in Railway dashboard
```

### 3. Monitor Deployment

```bash
# View logs
railway logs

# View environment
railway variables
```

### 4. Test Video Analysis

```bash
# Use our test script
npm run test:video-analysis
```

## üéØ Performance Optimization

### Railway-Specific Optimizations

1. **Memory Usage:**

   - Railway provides 1GB RAM by default
   - Large videos may require more memory
   - Consider upgrading plan for heavy usage

2. **Disk Space:**

   - Ephemeral storage for temp files
   - Clean up files immediately after processing
   - No persistent storage needed for temp files

3. **Processing Time:**
   - Railway has request timeouts
   - Large videos may need async processing
   - Consider background job queues for long videos

### FFmpeg Settings for Railway

```typescript
// Optimized FFmpeg args for Railway
const ffmpegArgs = [
  "-i",
  inputPath,
  "-c:v",
  "libx264",
  "-c:a",
  "aac",
  "-preset",
  "fast", // Faster encoding
  "-crf",
  "28", // Slightly lower quality for speed
  "-movflags",
  "+faststart",
  "-threads",
  "2", // Limit threads for Railway
  "-y",
  outputPath,
];
```

## üîç Debugging

### Enable Debug Logs

```typescript
// Add to your Railway environment variables
(DEBUG = ffmpeg), gemini, video - analysis;
```

### Check FFmpeg Installation

```bash
# SSH into Railway container (when available)
which ffmpeg
ffmpeg -version
ls -la /nix/store/*/bin/ffmpeg
```

### Test FFmpeg Manually

```bash
# Test basic FFmpeg functionality
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i testsrc=duration=1:size=320x240:rate=1 test.mp4
```

## üìà Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Response Times:**

   - Video download time
   - FFmpeg conversion time
   - Gemini analysis time
   - Total request time

2. **Error Rates:**

   - FFmpeg failures
   - Gemini API errors
   - Network timeouts

3. **Resource Usage:**
   - Memory consumption
   - CPU usage during conversion
   - Disk space for temp files

### Railway Logging

```typescript
// Structured logging for Railway
console.log(
  JSON.stringify({
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    level: "info",
    message: "Video analysis started",
    videoUrl: url,
    environment: "railway",
  })
);
```

## üÜò Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check Railway logs: `railway logs`
2. Verify FFmpeg installation in container
3. Test with smaller video files first
4. Reference [Railway FFmpeg Forum](https://railway.app/help/fix-ffmpeg-issues)
5. Check our test script output
